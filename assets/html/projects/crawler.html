    <p> Project Crawler is an attempt at replicating a dungeons and dragons character creator based on the likes of</p>
    <p> <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">D&D Beyond</a> & <a href="https://www.dungeonmastersvault.com/">Dungeon
        Master's Vault</a></p>

    <p> I am an avid D&D Enjoyer and with very few alternatives out there, I wanted to take a shot at making my own
      character builder.</p>
    <p> I have not yet got to the stage of building the main application, but i have used it to learn more about async
      requests using jquery's ajax features, building up my knowledge of front-end development and server side
      development
      by hosting a webserver locally with a database using MariaDB, Apache and Ubuntu Server.</p>
